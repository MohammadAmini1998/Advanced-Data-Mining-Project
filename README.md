# Outlier Detection through Null Space Analysis of Neural Networks

This project implements the outlier detection method described in the paper "Outlier Detection through Null Space Analysis of Neural Networks" by Bremer et al. The method is based on leveraging the null space of neural networks to detect outliers in high-dimensional data.

### Paper Overview

The paper "Outlier Detection through Null Space Analysis of Neural Networks" proposes a novel approach to outlier detection using the null space of neural networks. Traditional outlier detection methods often struggle with high-dimensional data, but this method effectively leverages the ability of neural networks to capture complex relationships in the data. This works by computing and controlling the magnitude of the null space projection as data is passed through a network. Using these projections, we can then calculate a score that can differentiate between normal and abnormal data
